# ZielClient

Team Quartz client-side Android project. 

Navigation software designed to facilitate a channel which allows assistance to be delivered to an individual.  

## Getting Started

* Run `git clone https://github.com/COMP30022-18/ZielClient.git` in your terminal.
* Open repository with Android Studio.
* Navigate [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/2/project/zielbase/settings/general/android:com.quartz.zielclient), download the `google-services.json` file, and place it under the `app` folder
* Follow the instructions in [this link](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/) to set up your emulator.

Please note that we use Android SDK Version 28.

## Testing

Running tests can be accomplished using the Android Studio test configuration - see [this link](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/) for details.

Unit tests and UI tests should be completed for all major pieces of functionality.

## Coding Style


The code style we obey is the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Failure to obey this will result in a pull request being denied until the code is appropriately formatted (this is simple to do with Android Studio - navigate to Preferences/Editor/Code Style/Java, and then make the required changes). To reformat code in Android studio, use the appropriate keybinding (by default, Command+Alt+L on Mac, Ctrl+Alt+L on Windows, and Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L on Linux).

The complete list of coding practices is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXHFtnGiAb5NsvctyE-T2N9ISuCY1cBWbTEWLzMq3gI).
